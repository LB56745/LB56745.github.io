### **Goodbye Big Tech!**

Hello! 

If you’re made it here, you’re probably wanting to move away from big tech email providers and find an alternative that’s private, secure and doesn’t have snooping eyes and ulterior motives! 

If you’ve used a big tech provider like Gmail, Yahoo or Outlook it will be no surprise that you’re tired of all the invasive and weird advertising, the data mining, and even the scanning of your private messages. It’s scary to think how much they know about us, and how they use this against us. 

But fear not! I’ve did A LOT of research, tried and tested multiple email providers and found the perfect one: [Tuta Mail.](https://tuta.com/) 

Tuta Mail is based in Germany – so luckily, because it’s part of the EU it is fully GPDR compliant, and being a privacy-focused email provider they actually have much stricter security than what’s required by the EU. 
 
I highly rate Tuta Mail as the [best email service for privacy and security.](https://tuta.com/blog/best-private-email-service)

Why did I choose Tuta Mail?

Okay, so there are many reasons I chose Tuta over the other private email providers. First of all, the whole Tuta mailbox and even their calendar is end-to-end encrypted, I also really appreciate that Tuta is fully open-source. This gives me peace of mind knowing only the intended recipient can see whats in the email, and I don’t have any snooping about. 

Tuta is a super ethical, well run company – they believe privacy should be accessible for everybody, which is why you can even get a [Tuta mail account for free.](https://tuta.com/blog/best-free-email-accounts) With big tech providers we always think it’s free but in reality we are paying with our data. 

Another major benefit is that you can create a Tuta account and remain [fully anonymous](https://tuta.com/blog/anonymous-email/) – they don’t need your cellphone number, your name, or any personal information. 


There are other privacy-focused email providers out there which are also great! But, before you create an account with them, I’d always make sure they are not part of the [5 eyes!](https://tuta.com/blog/posts/fourteen-eyes-countries)
