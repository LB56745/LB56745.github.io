**Goodbye Big Tech!**

Hello! 

If you’re made it here, you’re probably wanting to move away from big tech email providers and find an alternative that’s private, secure and doesn’t have snooping eyes and ulterior motives! 

If you’ve used a big tech provider like Gmail, Yahoo or Outlook it will be no surprise that you’re tired of all the invasive and weird advertising, the data mining, and even the scanning of your private messages. It’s scary to think how much they know about us, and how they use this against us.
